# Theory Overview

TumorTwin is a modular, open-source Python framework for creating personalized digital twins in oncology.
It enables prediction of tumor growth and treatment response by integrating MRI data with mathematical
modeling. The core theory combines a reaction-diffusion PDE with treatment effects, numerical solvers,
and gradient-based optimization.

This documentation provides a theoretical overview of the main modeling components implemented in TumorTwin:
